# SwiftyICER

> Simple SwiftUI view for decoding of ICER-encoded images

Uses [`TheRealOrange/icer_compression`](https://github.com/TheRealOrange/icer_compression)
as the underlying ICER decoding implementation. Check it out for more information
regarding the ICER image compression format. In a gist, ICER is a...

> progressive, wavelet-based image compression algorithm designed to be resistant
> to data loss, making it suitable for use as the image compression algorithm
> when encoding images to be transmitted over unreliable delivery channels,
> such as those in satellite radio communications.
